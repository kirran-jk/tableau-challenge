# tableau-challenge: Citi Bike Analytics

This repository contains analysis on New York Citi Bike data for the following months: November 2021, December 2021, July 2022, August 2022.

Two phenomena were uncovered from this data:

 * Riding patterns remain relatively similar during winter months as they are in the summer months, despite a large reduction in the number of rides that take place in winter.

 * The top used starting and ending stations are the same, due to the majority of users of this scheme being commuters who are travelling to and from work.

 * The interactive map further emphasises the point above where the majority of rides are clustered in the same area which is the central area for workers.
